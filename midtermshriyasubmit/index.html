    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline dotted white;">This website is all about BLACKPINK! You'll find everything about them, from when they started, to what they're doing now!</h3>
    <p>On the About page of this website, you'll find information about every member and their background throughout their careers. They have all achieved a lot, so I thought it would be nice to give them each their own little section. Additionally, you'll find that the design on that page was intentionally done with their signature colors, so that will be cool to see as well. On the gallery page, there is an image and caption of their current "era" and vibe which is cool to see. You'll also find individual photos of them, specifically their album covers along with a small description. Where you are is the Home page, which will tell you exactly what this website is about, and help you learn about what you'll find here. Have fun navigating this website!</p>
